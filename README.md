# SetupMySysGuide_MyDotFiles
This repo contains my work setup guid and dot files to save my time and standardize and automize my work setup and workflow.

First of all I have installed the manjaro i3 edition and on top of that installed
kde desktop. 

For window decoration the best theme was:

"Mojave Dark Aurorae"

best latte layour:

"macos-classic-small-float"

In the future ...

	1. using oh-my-bash for bash setup. nicer and simpler. 

	2. use bellow repository for xxh:

	https://github.com/xxh/xxh

	using xxh instead of ssh, you can have the fancy features of oh-my-bash
	, oh-my-zsh and ... over the ssh session.

	3. usefull addresses for automatically generate .gitignore files for 
	   your project. you need to install the command line function in your
	   shell configuration:

	   https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore

	   https://docs.gitignore.io/install/command-line

	4. installation git-flow(avh is in arch linux). bellow addresses are related
	   to installation and workflow of gitflow and tutorial of how to use it:

	   https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Linux

	   https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html

	   https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html

	5. installation of github-flow. bellow addresses are repository and tutorial
	   about how this workflow works:

	   https://github.com/github-flow/github-flow

	   https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

	   note that I used the repository command to install it but I don't know 
	   why it does not work. actually I had not the command-line and I did not
	   know where is the sources or things related to it. so I cloned it and 
	   and have ran the install script preceding by sudo and it caused some npm
	   installations. after that I copied the commands lines from the repository
	    bin directory to '/usr/bin/'. so now I think(I have not tested on a 
	    repository yet, but commands are existed on shell.) I can use it.

	6. I have added settings to '.tmux.conf' file for having 4 key-binds to 
	   navigate through tmux panes like we navigate in vim. actully using prefix
	   key and <Ctrl-hjkl>.

	
## Note 2021-01-28 01:39:
I have installed colorls from AUR repositories and dracula (modified it as my 
favorites) from "https://draculatheme.com/colorls/". adding some aliases for 
using it in the .zshrc and .bashrc files. also i added the vimium dracula theme
from dracula official website.
-TODO: in the not very near future(i spend too much time on config my stuffs.) i
will replace i3lock with a better option like i3lock-color which as I think has the
ability for customize its colors.


# In Future ...
