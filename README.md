# SetupMySysGuide_MyDotFiles
This repo contains my work setup guid and dot files to save my time and standardize and automize my work setup and workflow.

First of all I have installed the manjaro i3 edition and on top of that installed
kde desktop. 

For window decoration the best theme was:

"Mojave Dark Aurorae"

best latte layour:

"macos-classic-small-float"

In the future ...
