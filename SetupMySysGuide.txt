So I want to fully switch to manjaro linux. And Also I want to Standardize my steps
to setup my workspace to save more time. may be in the future automize it. Note that
I will use manjaro KDE and in a distinct session i3 window manager.

so after installing manjaro linux and after Update the system I will do:
    
    1. move the window buttons to left in KDE.
    2. Active AUR and select the check for updates box.
    3. Kate->Settings->Configure Kate->Editing->General->Input Mode->Select Vi Input Mode.
    4. install tmux(OFR) and tmux-bash-completion(AUR).
    5. install powerline and powerline-fonts from OFR, then add below to your ~/.bashrc file to enable it in terminal:
        powerline-daemon -q
        POWERLINE_BASH_CONTINUATION=1
        POWERLINE_BASH_SELECT=1
        . /usr/share/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh
    and add below to your ~/.tmux.conf to enable status line in tmux sessions:
        source /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/powerline/bindings/tmux/powerline.conf
    6. install figlet from OFR to print text banners line the one at top of this file.
    7. install neovim from OFR.
    8. install i3-wm, i3lock, i3status from OFR(i think i installed dmenu Also from OFR).
    9. Go to System Settings-> Hardware Configuration -> Atuo Install Proprietary Driver. this installs hybrid bumblebee GPU Drivers.
    10. in Steam add this to launch options of Counter Strike to enable nvidia GPU (As I Know, but it is not good yet as windows games):
        primusrun steam steam://rungameid/730
	Update(Fr 22. Mai 01:43:49 CEST 2020):
		As I mentioned the performance of the bumblebee is not as good as windows. so i was not interested in it. so i find two way to get the better performance:
			1. using optimus-manager: the instruction to setup this can be found at below link:
				https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager
			i like the way how it works and has GUI interface and hybrid support and easy switch between intel and nvidia. like in windows. but like in windows
			i have a problem in steam games like CSGO. I think the Nvidia card gets too hot and system suddenly shuts down. so i love this option but i can't use
			it on this system.
			2. Set up PRIME with NVIDIA proprietary driver(I use This): the instruction to setup this can be found at below link:
				https://forum.manjaro.org/t/howto-set-up-prime-with-nvidia-proprietary-driver/40225
			this way has good performance on games and has not the problem of the first way. but nvidia and intel are both ON and so power consumption is high, but
			i think(i think!!!) this feature in my system solves the problem of first way, because i think!!! in this way the computation loads divide between intel
			and nvidia so the temperature of nvidia and laptop does not go high and system does not shut down suddenly(this is my think!!!).
		in each situation i uninstalled video-linux and bumblebee drivers and installed video-nvidia-418xx(using manjaro system settings).
		!!! NOTE !!! : I you have done something wrong and manjaro does not boot and after asus logo shows just black screen, don't be afraid. in grub boot menu list on
		manjaro press "e" and then at the end of linux line add "3" then press F10. so you will go to tty session. in there using "nmcli" connect to internet or your wifi
		and then solve the problem, e.g. using mhwd uninstall all video drivers and install bumblebee and then reboot. so you can boot to your manjaro!
    11. in System Settings go to Input Devices->keyboard->layouts and add German(QWERTY) and Persian Keyboards and Meta+Space as Alternative Shortcut to change the Languages.
    12. Setup Git:
        git is installed by default so you just run below commands in terminal:
        git config --global user.name "username"
        git config --global user.email email@example.com
        git config --global core.editor nvim
    13. Customize the i3:
    		1. install polybar from OFR to create a clean bar for i3.
		2. setup XDG base directory for config files which is a nice thing to have a clean system:
			add below line at the end of your ~/.bashrc file:
				export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=${HOME}/.config
    !!! NOTE !!! : Till here I used GUI package manager and I as I remember I install all Optional dependency for installed Packages.
