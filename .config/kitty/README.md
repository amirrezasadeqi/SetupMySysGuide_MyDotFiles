# Notes about kitty terminal:

2021-01-26 12:57:

This terminal is unic in rendering the icons. it renders them smooth with no incontinuity.
it is too big so if i had volume constrains i will use st(default) or alacritty(not configured
yet.)

the most important things i added now to the default kitty from manjaro officials are:

	- adding the dracula theme for kitty and its diff kitten. also i have modified
	  dracula a little to make it like the dracula pro.
	- replace nvim for backscroll history pager. this feature is nice.
	- disable sound bell. it was annoying.

In the future i will customize it more to have bindings like the st build binds to
have a seamless workflow. useful links in this progress are:

so enjoy it!!!
